	<p>The Cocktail Chemists, Dimitrios (Dim) Zahariadis and Carl Summa, met in 2008 while beating the shit out of each other in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, well truth be told, when Carl was beating the shit out of Dim.  Carl was intrigued that Dim kept leaving for trips around the world while working for various spirit companies and immediately wanted in on that glamorous lifestyle, so Dim took Carl under his wing and the rest is history.  Both these gents, now award winning bartenders, have spent countless hours perfecting their craft, educating themselves and others around them so that the guests in their establishmentsâ€™ can have a proper bar experience to compliment their culinary experience.
